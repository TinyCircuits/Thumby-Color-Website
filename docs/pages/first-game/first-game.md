# First Game
To create a very basic scene we need to:

* Import `engine_main` to set the engine up
* Import `engine` for starting or ticking
* Import the nodes we want and a camera
* Create the nodes
* Start the engine

```py
import engine_main
import engine
from engine_nodes import Rectangle2DNode, CameraNode

rectangle = Rectangle2DNode()
camera = CameraNode()

engine.start()
```
