### How to Play Original Thumby Games
You'll need to do the following:

1. Download code editor <a href="https://github.com/TinyCircuits/TinyCircuits-Thumby-Code-Editor/archive/refs/heads/master.zip" target="_blank" alt="Firmware">**files**</a>
2. Extract the downloaded folder
3. Open Thonny and connect **Thumby Color** or **Thumby Color Dev Kit** (see "Getting Started With Thonny" for more help)
4. In the **top-left** pane of Thonny, navigate to `TinyCircuits-Thumby-Code-Editor/CoreThumbyFiles` (downloaded earlier)
5. Right-click the `lib` folder and click `Upload to /`

The above steps add the library files to **Thumby Color** for running original Thumby games.

To add games, download them to your computer and upload each game folder to `/Games` on your **Thumby Color** device. Original Thumby games will show up in the launcher with a question mark icon.

### Add More Storage to Thumby Color

For now, Thumby Color is limited to 13 MB in storage. The games are easy to swap in and out and the save files will remain on the Thumby Color so that you can take games that have saved data off the Thumby without losing high scores or other saved game variables.

### Charging & Battery Life

**How long can I play Thumby on a full charge?**

You can play Thumby Color for up to two hours on a full charge. Games that use the vibration motor, speaker, or change the processor base frequency will use more power and drain the battery faster.

**How long does Thumby take to charge? Is there an indicator when it is charged?**

Thumby Color takes around 2 hours to completely charge. An indicator LED will turn on from inside the Thumby case to show that the battery is being charged. The LED will turn off when the battery is fully charged. The LED is located to the left of the micro USB connector.

*Note: The charging LED may be difficult to see through opaque plastic cases. Try turning off the lights in the room you are in if you are having difficulty seeing the LED while charging.*
